------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Experimental Process
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To evaluate the recall of a clone detection tool you must complete the following steps:

1. Register the clone detection tool with BigCloneEval.
2. Detect clones in IJaDataset using the clone detection tool.
3. Import the detected clones into BigCloneEval.
4. Configure and execution the evaluation experiment.

These steps are performed using BigCloneEval's commands, which are located in the command/
directory as scripts.  These scripts must be executed from within the command directory
(the command directory must be the working directory).

In the next section we outline the available commands.  Then we discuss how each step can
be performed in detail.  Then we include specific documentation for each command.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Commands Summary
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The commands are available in the 'commands/' directory, and should be executed from that
directory.  Executing the commands with the "-h" flag will show their parameters.

A summary of the commands are as follows:

	registerTool
		Registers a clone detection tool with the framework.  Requires a name and
		description of the tool, which is stored in the tools database.  Returns a unique
		identifier for the tool for indicating the target tool for the other commands.
		Name and description are for reference by the user.

	listTools
		Lists the tools registered in the database.  Including their ID, name and
		description.
		
	deleteTool
		Deletes a tool, specified by its ID, from the framework.  Also removes any
		imported clones for this tool.
		
	detectClones
		Executes the clone detection tool for IJaDataset in an automated procedure.
		Requires a script that configures and executes the tool, and the scalability
		limits of the tool in terms of the maximum input size measured in source files.
		Used deterministic input partitioning to overcome scalability limits.  Optional,
		clone detection can be performed manually if desired.  See documentation below for
		more details.
	
	partitionInput
		Employs deterministic input partitioning to split an input that is too large for
		a tool to process into a number of smaller inputs.  When the tool is executed for
		the smaller inputs, and the detected clones merged, it is equivalent to executing
		the tool for the larger input (that may be outside of the tool's scalability
		constraints).  This command is useful if executing your tool manually.  This
		is automatically used with the detectClones command.
	
	importClones
		Imports the clones detected by a tool in IJaDataset into the framework for
		evaluation.  Clones are provided as clone pairs in a simple CSV file.  See
		documentation below for the expected format.
		
	clearClones
		Removes the imported clones for the specified registered tool.
	
	evaluate
		Measures the recall of the specific tool based on the clones imported for it.
		Highly configureable, including using custom clone-matching algorithms.
		Summarizes recall per clone type, per inter vs intra-project clones, per
		functionality in BigCloneBench and for different syntactical similarity regions
		in the output tool evaluation report.
		
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Step 1: Register Tool
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First the tool must be registered to the framework.  This is done by the registerTool
command, which requires a name and description of the tool.  The intention is for the user
to use the name field to record the name and version of the tool, and the description to
denote the configuration used in the detection experiment.  These are stored for later
reference by the user.  A unique identifier is output for the user to refer to this tool
in the latter steps.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Step 2: Clone Detection
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next the tool must be executed for IJaDataset.  This can be done manually or using our 
detectClones command.  Use the method which is easiest for your tool.

Manually
--------
You must execute the tool for each subdirectory in 'ijadataset/bcb_sample'.  For example,
you must execute the tool for 'ijadataset/bcb_sample/2' and 'ijadataset/bcb_sample/3',
etc.  Each sub-directory is the files from the full IJaDataset that contain clones of one
of the functionalities in BigCloneBench.

Some of these sub-directories may contain too many source files for the scalability
constraints of some tools, particularly those that require significant memory.  In this
case the partitionInput command can be used to split these inputs into a number of smaller
inputs given a maximum number of files the tool can reliably handle.

Automatically
-------------
To use the automatic clone detection procedure, a script must be provided that configures
and executes the tool.  On Linux and OSX this is expected to be a bash script, and it
executed using "bash -c /path/to/script/ /path/to/clone/detection/input/".  On Windows,
this is expected to be a command script, and is executed using
"cmd.exe /c C:\path\to\script\ C:\path\to\clone\detection\input\".

The script is expected to take as a parameter a directory which contains source code
(possibly in sub-directories) for clone detection to be executed on.  The script should
configure and execute the tool, and output the detected clones to stdout.  The script
should terminate with an exit code of 0 if it was successful, or non-zero if it failed.
The tool should not output anything to stdout except for the detected clones.  Ideally,
the clones should be output in the format expected by the importClones command (see the
next step), although any output is supported.  

The 'sample/' directory contains the nicadRunner as an example bash script targeting
Linux/OSX, and and iclonesRunner.cmd command script targeting Windows.  Note that these
scripts won't run as is, and will require downloading and installing the clone detection
tools, and modifying the runner to work with your computer's environment.

The detectClones command takes this script as input, the maximum files the tool can handle
without scalability issues on the available hardware, and a scratch directory to use in
case input partitioning is required for scalability issues (otherwise the OS tmp directory
is used).

detectClones then executes the script with each sub-directory in 'ijadatset/bcb_sample/'
as input, using input partitioning on the sub-directories that exceed the tool's indicated
scalability constraints.  The output from each execution is concatenated into a final
output file.

Note that due to the nature of how we reduced IJaDataset, and how input partitioning
works, the final output may contain some duplicated clones (not the fault of the tool
itself).  These can be trimmed from the output if desired, but will not affect the
evaluation results.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Step 3: Import Clones
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The next step is to import the clones, which is done using the importClones command.  This
takes the ID of the registered tool, and a file containing the clones.  The importClones
command expects the clones to be formatted in a simple CSV file, where each line specifies
one clone pair in the following format:

cf1_subdirectory,cf1_filename,cf1_startline,cf1_endline,cf2_subdirectory,cf2_filename,cf2_endline

For example:

selected,102353.java,10,20,default,356923.java,20,30
sample,DownloadWebpage.java,20,50,selected,10234,356123.java,30,50

Where cf#_subdirectory,cf#_filename,cf#_startline,cf#_endline specifies one of the code
fragments.  And the order of the code fragments in the clone pair does not matter.

cf#_subdirectory is the sub-directory of IJaDataset the source file is found in.
IJaDataset has three subdirectories: "selected", "default" and "sample".  For example,
sub-input 'ijadataset/bcb_sample/2' contains a 'selected', 'default' and 'sample'
directory.  The meaning behind the sub-directories is not important, but it needs to be
specified to fully resolve the source file.

If your tool outputs clone classes, they need to be converted into clone pairs for this
format.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Step 4: Execute evaluation.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The evaluate command is used to measure the recall of the clone detection tool for
BigCloneBench based on its imported clones.  This takes the ID of the tool, a file to
output the tool evaluation report to, and a number of configuration options for
customizing the recall evaluation experiment.

Clone Matcher
-------------
A clone matcher must be specified.  This is the algorithm used to determine if a reference
clone in the benchmark is sufficiently captured by a candidate clone reported by the tool
for the reference clone to be considered as detected by the candidate tool.

BigCloneEval includes our coverage-based clone matching algorithm.  More details are
provided below in the Command Documentation section.  This is implemented in a plugin
architecture such that users can implement their own clone matching algorithm using our
existing algorithm as a template.

The clone matcher to be used is specified by name, including a parameter string, when 
the evaluate command is used.

Reference Clone Constraints
---------------------------
A number of configuration parameters place constraints on which reference clones are
considered when measuring recall.  The following constraints are available:

	minimum clone size in tokens, original source files, and/or pretty-printed source lines
	maximum clone size in tokens, original source files, and/or pretty-printed source lines
	minimum confidence
	minimum judges

The clone size constraints makes it easy to set a standard clone size for the experiment
and appropriately and fairly configure your candidate tools for their benchmark
experiment.  Clone size constraints are available in the major ways in which clone size
is typically measured.

The minimum judges constraint selects only those clones whose code fragments (functions)
have been examined by a minimum number of judges.  Each code fragment has been inspected
for the functionality of the clone by at least one judge.  Some have been examined by
multiple judges in order to measure the accuracy of the judging.  This way you can select
just those examined by some number of judges.  Only a small portion has been examined by
multiple judges currently.  In future we hope to have the entire benchmark examined by
multiple judges.

Similar to the minimum judges, the minimum confidence is the minimum agreement when
multiple judges are used.  This is, for both code fragments, the minimum difference in
true positive vs false positive votes by the judges.  Currently a small portion of the
data has been seen by more than two judges, where this constraint is relevant.

Similarity Type
---------------
The user can specify how the syntactical similarity of the reference clones should be
measured.  BigCloneBench includes syntactical similarity measured both by line and by
token after Type-1 and Type-2 normalizations.  This includes a strict pretty-printing,
the removal of comments, blind identifier renaming and literal abstraction.  Similarity
is measured as the minimum ratio of the lines or tokens one code fragment in the clone
pair shares with the other.  Shared lines or tokens are identified with the diff algorithm
which considers the order of the lines or tokens.

Syntactical similarity for the experimetn can then be measured by line, by token, by the
average of the line and token measures, or by both (using the smaller of the two).

We reccomend using 'both' as it is the most fair option when comparing token and
line-based tools without bias.  This is the setting we use in our studies, and when
reporting the clone demographics of BigCloneBench

Minimum Similarity
------------------
You can also specify the minimum syntactical clone similarity of clones to consider.  By
default, the evaluation considers the full scope of syntactical similarity, 0% to 100%.
However, most tools are syntax-based, and will have none or near-zero detection much
below their configured detection threshold.  So some execution time can be saved by
omitting the reporting of recall for these clones.  The minimum similarity to measure
recall to must be specified as a multiple of 5.

BigCloneBench divides Type-3 and Type-4 clones by their syntactical similarity into four
categories:

Very-Strongly Type-3   : Clones with 90% (inclsuive) to 100% (exclusive) shared syntax.
Strongly Type-3        : Clones with 70% (inclsuive) to  90% (exclusive) shared syntax.
Moderately Type-3      : Clones with 50% (inclsuive) to  70% (exclusive) shared syntax.
Weakly Type-3 / Type-4 : Clones with  0% (inclsuive) to  50% (exclusive) shared syntax.

These are canonical categories for BigCloneBench, but evaluate also reports recall for
every lower threshold and range of syntactical similarity (in 5% granularity).

Most syntax-based Type-3 tools operate mostly in the Very-Stringly and Strongly
categories.  AST and PDG type tools may have some recall in the moderately Type-3 category
as well, but not usually significant.

If time allows, it is best to run for full range.  However, executing for a minimum
similarity of 50% is sufficient for most tools, as they have 0% or near-0% for the Weakly
Type-3 / Type-4 category, and often similar for the Moderately Type-3.

Reccomended Settings
--------------------
The reccomended settings are as follows:

similarity type = both line and token (smaller measure)
minimum clone size in original source lines = 6 lines
minimum clone size in pretty-printed source lines = 6 lines
minimum clone size in tokens = 50 tokens
clone-matcher: Coverage clone matcher with 70% coverage threshold

These correspond to the settings we have used in our previous studies.+

Tool Evaluation Report
----------------------

The tool evaluation report sumamrizes recall from a number of perspectives.

Recall is reported per clone type.  Including Type-1, Type-2, Type-3 and Type-4.  The
recall for Type-2 is reported for different common definitions of Type-2.  Since there is
no agreed upon minimum similarity of a Type-3 clone, the Type-3 and Type-4 clones are
split into a number of categories.  Note that sine all of the clones are semantic clones
(implement a shared functionality), those which do not meet the Type-3 definition are 
Type-4 clones.  We summarize the per-clone-type categories below:

	Type-1: Recall for the Type-1 clones.
	Type-2: Recall for all Type-2 clones (most generous definition).
	Type-2 (blind): Type-2 clones which don't have a 1:1 mapping of identifier names.
	Type-2 (consistent): Type-2 clones which have a 1:1 mapping of identifier names.
	Very-Strongly Type-3: Clones with sytnactical similarity in range [90,100).
	Strongly Type-3: Clones with sytnactical similarity in range [70,90)
	Moderately Type-3: Clones with syntactical similarity in range [50,70)
	Weakly Type-3 or Type-4: Clones with syntactical similarity in range [0,50)
	
The categories assume that Type-4 clones share less than 50% of their syntax.  Most Type-3
clone detectors should have good recall in the Very-Strongly Type-3 range.  Very good
Type-3 detectors also have good recall in the Strongly Type-3 while maintaining good
precision.  It is expected that Moderately Type-3 clones are outside the scope of syntax
based clone detection approaches, unless precision is significantly compromised.  Other
techniques that do not rely so much on the syntax of the clone may perform better in this
range.  The weakly Type-3/Type-4 clones are probably outside the scope of most or all
clone detection techniques.

Recall is also reported for Type-3/Type-4 clones in different syntactical similarity
ranges.  It is reported for each range at a granularity of 5%: [0,5), [5,10), etc.  It is
also reported for each minimum syntactical similarity at a granularity fo 5%: [0,100),
[5,100), [10,100), etc.

Recall is reported for all clones, for just the inter-project clones, and for just the
intra-project clones.  Recall can then be compared for these different contexts.

Recall is also reported for all clones, and then also the clones of each individual
functionality in BigCloneBench.

The evaluation report summarizes the number of referenc clones consdierd in each
measurement.

The evaluation report documents the version of BigCloneEval and BigCloneBench used to
create it for future refernece.

Clone Matchers:

Coverage Matcher
----------------
	Requires the tool to report a candidate clone that covers a certain ratio of the
	reference clone for the reference clone to be considered detected.  Takes one or three
	parameters.  The first parameter is the coverage ratio.  We recommend a 0.70 coverage
	ratio.
	
	Optionally, the user can put a constraint on how far outside of the clone the
	candidate clone can extend while still being considered a match.  Since BigCloneBench
	has function clones, it is not desirable for the tool to report clones that extend 
	significant beyond the boundary of the clone.  The user can specify a tolerance on
	the extension beyond the boundary of the reference clone by a number of original
	source lines, or a ratio of the size of the clone itself.
	
	Examples:
	
		"CoverageMatcher 0.7"
			The candidate clone must cover 70% of the reference clone by line.  The
			candidate clone can extend indefinitely beyond the boundaries of the reference
			clone without punishment.
			
		"CoverageMatcher 0.7 line 2"
			The candidate clone must cover 70% of the reference clone by line.  If the
			candidate clone extends 2 line beyond the boundary of the reference clone (by
			either code fragment) then the candidate clone is rejected as a match.
			
		"CoverageMatcher 0.7 ratio 0.20"
			The candidate clone must cover 70% of the reference clone by line.  If the
			candidate clone extends 20% beyond the boundary of the reference clone, by
			each code fragment's size in lines, then the candidate clone is rejected as a
			match.
			
	See the source file 'src/cloneMatchingAlgorithm/CoverageMatcher' for more details.


Custom Clone Matcher
--------------------
	To provide your own clone matcher, create a class implementing the CloneMatcher
	interface.  Your custom clone matcher must be in the 'cloneMatchingAlgorithms'
	package, and on the classpath.  Ideally, install your compiled .class in the
	'bin/cloneMatchingAlgorithms' directory.  The clone matchers are discovered by
	reflection at runtime.  Your custom clone matcher must have a constructor which takes
	an long as its first parameter and a string as it second parameter.  The long is the
	ID of the tool being evaluated, and the string is the configuration string specified
	in the execution of evaluate.  You specify your clone matcher as such when executing
	the evaluate command:
	
	"MyCloneMatcher arg1 arg2 arg3"
	
	The constructor of your clone matcher will be called with the ID of the tool, and then
	"arg1 arg2 arg3" as the configuration string.
	
	Your clone matcher implements the isDetected(Clone clone) method.  It should check if
	the specified reference clone was detected using a query over the tool's clone table.
	
	The tool's clone table will be named: tool_$ID$_clones, where $ID$ is the ID of the
	tool.  The clone table has fields: type1, name1, startline1, endline1, type2, name2,
	startline2, endline2.  Where the start/end lines are integers, and the other
	parameters are strings (varchar).
	
	This is in the tools DB, which a connection to this database is available by the
	ToolsDB class.
	
	Your clone matcher should check both orderings of the reference clone's code fragments
	as they may be reversed in the tool's detected clones.
	
	See the existing CoverageMatcher as a template.
	
	BigCloneEval is distributed as an eclipse project.  So the easiest way to develop
	your own clone matcher is to open BigCloneEval as an eclipse Java project and
	develop your code from there.

Example:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
$./evaluate -t 3 -o ~/report -st both -m Coverage "CoverageMatcher 0.7 ratio 0.2" -mis 50 -mil 10 -mip 10 -mit 50
